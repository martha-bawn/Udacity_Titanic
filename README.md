# Udacity_Titanic
Project 2 for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree   
Intro to Data Analysis course

## Description
In this assignment, I explored a dataset using Python and Pandas. It contains information 
about the passengers on the Titanic and looked for meaningful trends and correlations 
related to which passengers survived. The dataset is available [here] 
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). In future I plan to revisit this dataset
and add some more interesting statistics to this project.
